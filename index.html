            <h1>Meowtronauts conquers space</h1>
            <p>
                In recent years, cats have become more than just themselves.
                They created their own space agency called "Meowtronauts "
                and are ready to bring their plans into reality.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first step on the way to conquering space is
                <span data-tooltip="Satellite of the Earth">Moon</span>
                Cats have developed an ambitious plan to conquer our satellite.
                They have already sent their future "Meowtronauts" on preparatory
                lunar expeditions to study the compatibility of sand with the tray.
            </p>

            <p>
                "This is our chance to show the whole world that cats are the true
                pioneers of space," said Meowtronauts chief Whisker von Meowenstein.
                "We will appoint our representative on the moon and create
                a galactic empire of our own."
            </p>

            <p>
                The cats also plan to create a secret army of space mice that will
                work as agents provocateurs on other planets, provoking
                interplanetary cat battles.
            </p>

                </div>
            </section>

            <p>
                Of course, cats have also developed their own space module
                to travel to the moon - "Meow-1". It is equipped with amazing technology,
                such as laser mice for hunting space strawberries and a jet engine based
                on a suspended bowl of water.
            </p>

            <p>
                It would seem that cats have embarked on an absurd plan to conquer space.
                However, if there's even a chance we'll see cat sandcastles on the moon
                one day, why not? Cats have always been masters of unexpected moves and incomprehensible adventures.
            </p>

            <p>
                So get ready to look to the skies and look for our
                meowtronauts on the moon, because the future of feline space
                conquest is upon us!
